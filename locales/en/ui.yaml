  hardware:
    keyboardHint: Press either Ctrl or Shift to buy 10 levels. Press both Ctrl and Shift to buy 100 levels.
    performance: 'Performance level: {{value}}'
    performanceHint: Higher performance level leads to faster running processes.
    cores: 'Cores level: {{value}}'
    coresHint: Additional cores allow better scalability and running more processes at same time.
    ram: 'RAM level: {{value}}'
    ramHint: Additional RAM allows to keep more processes in memory so they could ran later or in bigger batches.

    purchaseProgramDialogHint: Select program type, level and quality to purchase it.
      Level cannot be above current city development level.
      Quality is limited depending on gained favors.
      If you already have program with same name, old one will be replaced with new one.

  processes:
    processesHint: To make a program run, a process has to be start for it.
      Topmost processes have more priority when cores are assigned to processes.

    startProcessDialogHint: Select one of owned programs to start process for it.
      If you already have process for same program, old process will be replaced with new one.
      Threads allow to run multiple instances of same program at same time, but additional threads require additional memory.
