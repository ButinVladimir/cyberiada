  hardware:
    keyboardHint: Press either Ctrl or Shift to buy 10 levels. Press both Ctrl and Shift to buy 100 levels.
    performance: 'Performance level: {{value}}'
    performanceHint: Higher performance level leads to faster running processes.
    cores: 'Cores level: {{value}}'
    coresHint: Additional cores allow better scalability and running more processes at same time.
    ram: 'RAM level: {{value}}'
    ramHint: Additional RAM allows to keep more processes in memory so they could ran later or in bigger batches.
