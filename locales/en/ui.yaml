    programsHint: Program autoupgrade priority can be changed by dragging it by the title.
      Programs on top have higher priority. Autoupgrade for programs won"t change their quality but will attempt to increase level.

    purchaseProgramDialogHint: Select program type, level and quality to purchase it.
      Level cannot be above current development level.
      Quality is limited depending on gained favors.

  processes:
    processesHint: To make a program run, a process has to be start for it.
      Topmost processes for non-scalable programs have more priority when cores are assigned to processes.
      Process for scalable program has cores and RAM assigned last.
      Only one process for scalable program can run at same time.
      Process minimal completion time is limited.
      Processes can be rearranged by dragging them by their title.
    startProcess: Start process
    startProcessDialogHint: Select one of owned programs to start process for it.
      If you already have process for same program, old process will be replaced with new one.
      Threads allow to run multiple instances of same program at same time, but additional threads require additional memory.
